## 🌊 Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky Equation

**ChaosPINN** is a SciML-powered project that leverages **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve and visualize the **Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KS) equation**, a nonlinear PDE that models chaotic wave propagation in fluid dynamics, plasma, and reaction-diffusion systems.

## 🚀 Problem Statement & Impact
### **Understanding and Predicting Chaotic Systems**
Traditional numerical solvers struggle with chaotic systems due to computational inefficiency and sensitivity to initial conditions. This project demonstrates how **PINNs can efficiently learn and predict chaotic wave evolution**, providing scalable and interpretable solutions for real-world applications like:
- **Turbulence modeling** in fluid mechanics 🌪️
- **Pattern formation** in chemical and biological systems 🧪
- **Plasma instabilities** in fusion reactors ⚡

---

## 🧠 Suggested Solution
We train a **PINN using PyTorch** to learn the underlying physics of the KS equation by minimizing both data loss and physics-based constraints. Our model directly enforces the governing PDE as a loss term, leading to better generalization and robustness.

### **Kuramoto–Sivashinsky Equation:**
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^4 u}{\partial x^4} = 0 \]

This equation exhibits chaotic behavior, making it an ideal test case for evaluating PINNs against traditional solvers.
